# biodata
a website that helps in creating bio data for various uses
I have planned that many people need Bio-data for their works, interviews, marriages, job proposals, university selection etc, but don't really know how to build it. They know data, but are unsure what to put to make their Bio-data attractive.

The site will help them to do exactly the same. They can select various types of biodatas, and enter the data as the site asks them to. Then, the site will render them their bio data as required by the type, and they will just have to print it.
